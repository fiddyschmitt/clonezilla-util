- Explorer timeout when extraction takes too long. Aka: Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service
	- Ask Igor for 7z.exe update to "load and wait" archive, then read the command line for files to extract and send them to stdio
	- Consider caching the first 1KB of every file. Trickle that back in DokanVFS.ReadFile() until the full file is available
	
- extract file(s)

- Work out why there's a duplicate of:
	L:\sda1\Recovery\Logs\Reload.xml

- do a speed test to see if we should use 7z.exe to extract the images, of the 7z FM. 
	
- Compare DokanVFS to this one, and see if it runs better:
	C:\Users\fiddy\Desktop\dev\cs\Shaman.Dokan.Base-master\Shaman.Dokan.Base\FileSystemBase.cs
	C:\Users\fiddy\Desktop\dev\cs\Shaman.Dokan.Archive-master\Shaman.Dokan.Archive\SevenZipFs.cs


- Another app, using techniques from clonezilla-util
	extract-to-sparse (*.img.gz, *.img.zst)

	mount-img
		- img, img.gz, img.zst
		- program based
			- must provide full length
			- program can be given Position, count in stdin, and must supply stdout
