- Explorer timeout when extraction takes too long. Aka: Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service
	- Ask Igor for 7z.exe update with a "load and wait" option, then read the command line for files to extract and send them to stdout.
	- Consider caching the first 1KB of every file. Have a speacialised extractor which trickle that back until the full file is available.
	
- extract file(s) from command line

- Work out why there's a duplicate of:
	L:\sda1\Recovery\Logs\Reload.xml
	
- Compare DokanVFS to this one, and see if it runs better:
	C:\Users\fiddy\Desktop\dev\cs\Shaman.Dokan.Base-master\Shaman.Dokan.Base\FileSystemBase.cs
	C:\Users\fiddy\Desktop\dev\cs\Shaman.Dokan.Archive-master\Shaman.Dokan.Archive\SevenZipFs.cs


- Another app, using techniques from clonezilla-util
	extract-to-sparse (*.img.gz, *.img.zst)

	mount-img
		- img, img.gz, img.zst
		- program based
			- must provide full length
			- program can be given Position, count in stdin, and must supply stdout
